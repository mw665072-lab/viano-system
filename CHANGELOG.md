## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Removed Negotiated Wins editing from the property edit modal in Manage Properties. Negotiated Wins can now only be set during property creation.

### Fixed
- Skip subscription limit check when confirming an existing draft property. Previously, clicking a draft property to confirm it would incorrectly trigger the "Limit Reached" paywall, even though the user was not adding a new property but completing an existing draft.
